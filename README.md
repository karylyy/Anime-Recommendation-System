# Anime-Recommendation-System

For this project, I developed a machine learning-powered anime recommendation system. By inputting the title of an anime, the system offers suggestions for 10 other animes to consider watching. The process involves sifting through a vast database of 320,000 users and 16,000 animes. This entails analyzing individuals who have viewed the anime you entered, along with its summary. Subsequently, the system evaluates their ratings to propose animes they've highly rated as recommendations.

The database I used for this project was provided by user HERNAN VALDIVIESO on Kaggle. It contains data from myanimelist.net up to March 20th, 2020:
